# Data Format Specification

Technical specification for the CEOS data format. All EOS data is stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter — human-readable, git-friendly, and parseable by any language.

## Overview

CEOS uses a deliberately simple data format:

- **YAML frontmatter** for structured data (status, priority, dates, IDs)
- **Markdown body** for human-written content (notes, perspectives, outcomes)
- **File-per-record** pattern — each Rock, Issue, To-Do, and meeting is its own file
- **Directory-as-collection** pattern — `data/rocks/2026-Q1/` contains all Q1 Rocks

This format is the **portable contract** that tools depend on. Any tool that can parse YAML + markdown can read CEOS data — you're not locked into Claude Code.

## General Rules

### Frontmatter

YAML frontmatter is delimited by `---` on its own line:

```markdown
---
key: value
another_key: "quoted value"
---

# Markdown body starts here
```

- All date values use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- All string values with special characters should be quoted
- Enum values are lowercase with underscores: `on_track`, `off_track`

### File Naming

Files that represent individual records follow the pattern:

```
{type}-{NNN}-{slug}.md
```

- `{type}` — the record type (`rock`, `issue`)
- `{NNN}` — zero-padded numeric ID (`001`, `002`, `042`)
- `{slug}` — title slugified (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters)

Examples:
- `rock-001-launch-beta-program.md`
- `issue-003-slow-customer-onboarding.md`

### ID Generation

IDs are sequential within their type and directory. When creating a new record:

1. Scan all existing files in the relevant directories
2. Find the highest numeric ID
3. Increment by 1

For Issues, check **both** `data/issues/open/` and `data/issues/solved/` to avoid ID collisions.

## Rock Format

**Location:** `data/rocks/YYYY-QN/rock-NNN-slug.md`

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier (e.g., `rock-001`) |
| `title` | string | Yes | Short description of the Rock |
| `owner` | string | Yes | One person responsible (never shared) |
| `quarter` | string | Yes | Quarter in `YYYY-QN` format (e.g., `2026-Q1`) |
| `status` | enum | Yes | Current status (see below) |
| `created` | date | Yes | Date the Rock was created |
| `due` | date | Yes | Last day of the quarter |
| `milestones` | array | No | Array of milestone objects (see Milestone Object below) |
| `attachments` | array | No | Array of attachment reference objects (see Attachment Object below) |

### Status Values

| Value | Meaning | Set When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `on_track` | Progressing as expected | Default; updated during weekly tracking |
| `off_track` | Behind schedule or at risk | Updated during weekly tracking |
| `complete` | Measurable outcome achieved | End-of-quarter scoring only |
| `dropped` | No longer a priority | End-of-quarter scoring only |

### Body Structure

```markdown
# [Rock Title]

## Measurable Outcome

[Specific, verifiable definition of "done"]

## Milestones

- [ ] [First milestone]
- [ ] [Second milestone]
- [ ] [Third milestone]

## Notes

- YYYY-MM-DD: [Progress update or context]
```

### Milestone Object

Each entry in the optional `milestones` array:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Yes | Short description of the milestone |
| `due` | date | No | Target completion date (ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `status` | enum | Yes | Current status: `todo`, `in_progress`, `done` |

Milestone status values:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `todo` | Not started |
| `in_progress` | Work underway |
| `done` | Milestone achieved |

**Overdue** is computed, not stored: a milestone is overdue if `status` is not `done` and `due` is before today's date.

### Attachment Object

Each entry in the optional `attachments` array:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Relative path from CEOS root (e.g., `data/rocks/2026-Q1/spec.pdf`) |
| `label` | string | No | Display label (defaults to filename if omitted) |

Attachments are references only — the skill displays them but does not manage file uploads or validate file existence.

### Example

```markdown
---
id: rock-001
title: "Launch Beta Program"
owner: "brad"
quarter: "2026-Q1"
status: on_track
created: "2026-01-02"
due: "2026-03-31"
milestones:
  - title: "Beta invitation system built"
    due: "2026-02-01"
    status: done
  - title: "First 10 users onboarded"
    due: "2026-02-15"
    status: done
  - title: "Feedback collection process established"
    due: "2026-03-15"
    status: in_progress
attachments:
  - path: "data/rocks/2026-Q1/rock-001-beta-spec.pdf"
    label: "Original beta program spec"
---

# Launch Beta Program

## Measurable Outcome

Beta program launched with 10+ users actively providing feedback.

## Milestones

- [x] Beta invitation system built
- [x] First 10 users onboarded
- [ ] Feedback collection process established

## Notes

- 2026-01-02: Rock created for 2026-Q1
- 2026-01-15: Invitation system complete
- 2026-02-01: 12 users onboarded, ahead of schedule
```

**Note:** The example shows both frontmatter milestones (structured) and markdown checklist milestones (informal). Both are valid. When frontmatter milestones are present, tracking mode uses them for progress computation. The markdown checklist remains for quick human reference.

---

## Issue Format

**Location:** `data/issues/open/issue-NNN-slug.md` (open) or `data/issues/solved/issue-NNN-slug.md` (resolved)

### Frontmatter Fields

| `category` | enum | Yes | EOS issue category (see below) |
| `ids_stage` | enum | Yes | Current IDS stage (see below) |
| `created` | date | Yes | Date the issue was identified |

### Priority Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1` | Critical — solve first |
| `2` | High — solve soon |
| `3` | Medium — solve when time allows |
| `4` | Low — solve if capacity allows |
| `5` | Nice-to-have — backlog |

### Category Values (The 5 EOS Issue Types)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `people` | Right person, right seat issues |
| `process` | Systems, workflows, efficiency |
| `data` | Metrics, reporting, information gaps |
| `vision` | Alignment with V/TO, Core Focus |
| `traction` | Execution, accountability, follow-through |

### IDS Stage Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|

| `solved` | To-Dos created, issue resolved |

### Body Structure

```markdown
# [Issue Title]

## Identify

**Stated problem:**
> [What was originally reported]

**Root cause:**
> [After 5 Whys analysis]

## Discuss

- **[Name]:** [Their perspective]
- **[Name]:** [Their perspective]

## Solve

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Done |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| [Action item] | [Name] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [ ] |
```

### File Lifecycle

1. Created in `data/issues/open/` with `ids_stage: identified`
2. Updated to `ids_stage: discussed` after discussion
3. Updated to `ids_stage: solved` after To-Dos are created
4. Moved to `data/issues/solved/` when the IDS process is complete

Solved issues are never deleted — they serve as an audit trail.

### Example

```markdown
---
id: issue-003
title: "Slow customer onboarding"
priority: 1
category: process
ids_stage: solved
created: "2026-02-06"
---

# Slow customer onboarding

## Identify

**Stated problem:**
> New customers take 3+ weeks to complete onboarding

**Root cause:**
> Setup flow has 12 steps added for edge cases that affect <5% of users.
> No post-launch review process exists for customer-facing flows.

## Discuss

- **Brad:** We added those steps after two enterprise customers had issues.
  They shouldn't apply to standard tier.
- **Daniel:** Sales team is hearing complaints. It's affecting close rates.

## Solve

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Done |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| Audit onboarding flow, remove unnecessary steps | brad | 2026-02-20 | [x] |
| Create quarterly UX review process | daniel | 2026-02-20 | [ ] |

## Scorecard Metrics Format

**Location:** `data/scorecard/metrics.md`

This file defines the metrics your team tracks. It is not a weekly entry — it's the metric definitions that weekly entries reference.

### Structure

```markdown

## Metrics

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Frequency | Green | Red |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| [name] | [name] | [goal] | Weekly/Monthly | [threshold] | [threshold] |
```

No YAML frontmatter — this is a pure markdown reference document.

### Threshold Format

Green and Red thresholds define when a metric is on_track or off_track:

- `>= $50,000` — on_track when at or above the value
- `< 10` — off_track when below the value

### Example

```markdown
# Scorecard Metrics

## Acme Corp

## Metrics

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Frequency | Green | Red |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Weekly Revenue | brad | $50K | Weekly | >= $50K | < $50K |

---

## Accountability Chart Format

**Location:** `data/accountability.md`

Pure markdown document — no YAML frontmatter. Describes the company's organizational structure using EOS's "right person, right seat" framework.

| `evaluating` | Not yet fully assessed |

### Core Values Rating

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `+` | Exhibits the value most of the time |
| `+/-` | Exhibits the value sometimes |

## Clarity Break Format

**Location:** `data/clarity/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Multiple clarity breaks on the same day use a suffix: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `YYYY-MM-DD-2.md`, `YYYY-MM-DD-3.md`.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `date` | date | Yes | Date of the clarity break |
| `person` | string | Yes | Who took the clarity break |
| `duration` | string or null | No | How long the break lasted (e.g., `"45 min"`, `"2 hours"`) |
| `themes` | list | No | High-level themes that emerged |
| `issues_identified` | list | No | Specific issues to bring to the next L10 meeting |

### Body Structure

The Clarity Break is intentionally the least structured data type — it's designed for strategic thinking without rigid constraints.

```markdown
# Clarity Break — YYYY-MM-DD

## State of the Business

[Optional context gathered at the start. Can be skipped for free-form reflection.]

## Reflection

### What's working well?

[Open-ended]

### What's not working?

[Open-ended]

### What's missing?

[Open-ended]

### What needs to change?

[Open-ended]

## Issues Identified

[Issues to bring to the next L10 meeting]

## Notes

[Free-form thoughts, observations, and insights]
```

### Example

```markdown
---
date: "2026-02-15"
person: "Brad"
duration: "1 hour"
themes:
  - product-market fit
  - team capacity
issues_identified:
  - "Need to revisit pricing model before beta expansion"
  - "Engineering bandwidth stretched thin across too many apps"
---

# Clarity Break — 2026-02-15

## State of the Business

Alpha program running with 30 users. Positive feedback but slow feature iteration.

## Reflection

### What's working well?

User feedback loop is tight. Alpha users are engaged and providing actionable insights.

### What's not working?

Spreading engineering effort across 6 apps simultaneously. Each app gets incremental progress but none gets the deep investment needed to break through.

### What's missing?

A clear prioritization framework for which app gets focus each quarter.

### What needs to change?

Consider focusing 80% of engineering effort on AuthorMagic for the next two quarters. Other apps go to maintenance mode.

## Issues Identified

- Need to revisit pricing model before beta expansion
- Engineering bandwidth stretched thin across too many apps

## Notes

The "focus" insight keeps coming up. Read "Traction" chapter on Rocks again — the principle of "less is more" applies at the product level too.
```

## Kickoff Session Format

**Location:** `data/meetings/kickoff/` with three file patterns:
- `focus-day-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Focus Day (EOS introduction)
- `vb-day-1-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Vision Building Day 1
- `vb-day-2-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Vision Building Day 2

These are **one-time implementation sessions** that establish EOS in an organization. The typical sequence is: Focus Day first, then VB Day 1 (~30 days later), then VB Day 2 (~30 days after that).

### Frontmatter Fields (Shared)

All three session types share the same frontmatter:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `date` | date | Yes | Date of the session |
| `attendees` | string | Yes | Comma-separated list of attendees |
| `location` | string | No | Where the session was held |

### Focus Day Body Structure

7 sections covering EOS introduction and initial setup:

```markdown
# Focus Day — YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Welcome & EOS Overview

```

### Vision Building Day 1 Body Structure

5 sections focused on defining the organization's identity:

```markdown
# Vision Building Day 1 — YYYY-MM-DD

[Finalize 3-7 Core Values — discovered, not invented]

## 2. Core Focus Clarification
[Define Purpose/Cause/Passion and Niche]

## 3. 10-Year Target Setting
[Set one big, audacious, measurable target]

## 4. Marketing Strategy
[Target Market, Three Uniques, Proven Process, Guarantee]

## 5. Conclude
[Summary, action items, preparation for VB Day 2]
```

### Vision Building Day 2 Body Structure

5 sections focused on building the execution plan:

```markdown
# Vision Building Day 2 — YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. 3-Year Picture
[Vivid picture of the organization in 3 years — revenue, profit, headcount]

## 2. 1-Year Plan
[Specific goals for this year, 3-7 measurable targets]

## 3. Quarterly Rocks Setting
[3-7 most important priorities for the next 90 days]

## 4. Issues List Brainstorm
[Surface ALL issues — brain dump, not a solving session]

## 5. Conclude
[Summary, V/TO completion status, action items to formalize everything]
```

### Key Conventions

- **Rocks** are organized by quarter: `data/rocks/YYYY-QN/`
- **To-Dos** are flat in `data/todos/` (completed To-Dos stay in place with `status: complete`)
- **Issues** are organized by state: `data/issues/open/` and `data/issues/solved/`
- **Scorecard weeks** use ISO week numbering: `data/scorecard/weeks/YYYY-WNN.md`
- **L10 meetings** use date: `data/meetings/l10/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Vision and Accountability** are single files at the `data/` root
- **People** are one file per person: `data/people/firstname-lastname.md` (departed people in `alumni/`)
- **Conversations** are organized by quarter and person: `data/conversations/YYYY-QN/firstname-lastname.md`
- **Annual planning** uses year: `data/annual/YYYY-planning.md`
- **Quarterly planning** uses quarter: `data/quarterly/YYYY-QN-planning.md`
- **Checkups** use date: `data/checkups/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Delegate and Elevate** are one file per person: `data/delegate/firstname-lastname.md`
- **Clarity breaks** use date: `data/clarity/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (suffix `-2`, `-3` for multiples per day)
- **Kickoff sessions** use type-date: `data/meetings/kickoff/focus-day-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Processes** are per-process files: `data/processes/core-process-name.md`

## Parsing

To parse a CEOS data file in any language:

1. Read the file as text
2. Split on the first two `---` lines to extract YAML frontmatter
3. Parse the YAML block into a key-value structure
4. The remaining text is markdown — parse as needed

Most languages have YAML and markdown parsers available. The format is intentionally simple enough that a regex-based parser works for basic use cases.

## Versioning

The data format follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as part of the CEOS project:

- **Breaking changes** (renaming fields, changing status values, removing fields) require a major version bump and an RFC-style discussion
- **Non-breaking additions** (new optional fields) are minor version changes
- **Documentation and clarifications** are patch version changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the process around data format changes.
