# Data Format Specification

Technical specification for the CEOS data format. All EOS data is stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter — human-readable, git-friendly, and parseable by any language.

## Overview

CEOS uses a deliberately simple data format:

- **YAML frontmatter** for structured data (status, priority, dates, IDs)
- **Markdown body** for human-written content (notes, perspectives, outcomes)
- **File-per-record** pattern — each Rock, Issue, and meeting is its own file
- **Directory-as-collection** pattern — `data/rocks/2026-Q1/` contains all Q1 Rocks

This format is the **portable contract** that tools depend on. Any tool that can parse YAML + markdown can read CEOS data — you're not locked into Claude Code.

## General Rules

### Frontmatter

YAML frontmatter is delimited by `---` on its own line:

```markdown
---
key: value
another_key: "quoted value"
---

# Markdown body starts here
```

- All date values use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- All string values with special characters should be quoted
- Enum values are lowercase with underscores: `on_track`, `off_track`

### File Naming

Files that represent individual records follow the pattern:

```
{type}-{NNN}-{slug}.md
```

- `{type}` — the record type (`rock`, `issue`)
- `{NNN}` — zero-padded numeric ID (`001`, `002`, `042`)
- `{slug}` — title slugified (lowercase, hyphens, no special characters)

Examples:
- `rock-001-launch-beta-program.md`
- `issue-003-slow-customer-onboarding.md`

### ID Generation

IDs are sequential within their type and directory. When creating a new record:

1. Scan all existing files in the relevant directories
2. Find the highest numeric ID
3. Increment by 1

For Issues, check **both** `data/issues/open/` and `data/issues/solved/` to avoid ID collisions.

## Issue Format

**Location:** `data/issues/open/issue-NNN-slug.md` (open) or `data/issues/solved/issue-NNN-slug.md` (resolved)

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier (e.g., `issue-001`) |
| `title` | string | Yes | Short description of the issue |

| `created` | date | Yes | Date the issue was identified |

### Priority Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `1` | Critical — solve first |
| `2` | Important — solve soon |
| `3` | Minor — solve when time allows |

### Category Values (The 5 EOS Issue Types)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `people` | Right person, right seat issues |
| `process` | Systems, workflows, efficiency |
| `data` | Metrics, reporting, information gaps |
| `vision` | Alignment with V/TO, Core Focus |
| `traction` | Execution, accountability, follow-through |

### IDS Stage Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `identified` | Root cause found, not yet discussed |
| `discussed` | Perspectives captured, not yet solved |
| `solved` | To-Dos created, issue resolved |

### Body Structure

```markdown
# [Issue Title]

## Identify

**Stated problem:**
> [What was originally reported]

**Root cause:**
> [After 5 Whys analysis]

## Discuss

- **[Name]:** [Their perspective]
- **[Name]:** [Their perspective]

## Solve

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Done |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| [Action item] | [Name] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [ ] |
```

### File Lifecycle

1. Created in `data/issues/open/` with `ids_stage: identified`
2. Updated to `ids_stage: discussed` after discussion
3. Updated to `ids_stage: solved` after To-Dos are created
4. Moved to `data/issues/solved/` when the IDS process is complete

Solved issues are never deleted — they serve as an audit trail.

### Example

```markdown
---
id: issue-003
title: "Slow customer onboarding"
priority: 1
category: process
ids_stage: solved
created: "2026-02-06"
---

# Slow customer onboarding

## Identify

**Stated problem:**
> New customers take 3+ weeks to complete onboarding

**Root cause:**
> Setup flow has 12 steps added for edge cases that affect <5% of users.
> No post-launch review process exists for customer-facing flows.

## Discuss

- **Brad:** We added those steps after two enterprise customers had issues.
  They shouldn't apply to standard tier.
- **Daniel:** Sales team is hearing complaints. It's affecting close rates.

## Solve

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Done |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| Audit onboarding flow, remove unnecessary steps | brad | 2026-02-20 | [x] |
| Create quarterly UX review process | daniel | 2026-02-20 | [ ] |
```

```markdown
# Scorecard — YYYY-WNN

*Logged: YYYY-MM-DD*

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Actual | Status |
|--------|-------|------|--------|--------|

## Scorecard Metrics Format

**Location:** `data/scorecard/metrics.md`

This file defines the metrics your team tracks. It is not a weekly entry — it's the metric definitions that weekly entries reference.

### Structure

```markdown
# Scorecard Metrics

## [Company Name]

## Metrics

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Frequency | Green | Red |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| [name] | [name] | [goal] | Weekly/Monthly | [threshold] | [threshold] |
```

No YAML frontmatter — this is a pure markdown reference document.

### Threshold Format

Green and Red thresholds define when a metric is on_track or off_track:

- `>= $50,000` — on_track when at or above the value
- `< 10` — off_track when below the value

### Example

```markdown
# Scorecard Metrics

## Acme Corp

## Metrics

| Metric | Owner | Goal | Frequency | Green | Red |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Weekly Revenue | brad | $50K | Weekly | >= $50K | < $50K |
| New Customers | daniel | 10 | Weekly | >= 10 | < 10 |
| NPS | brad | 70 | Monthly | >= 70 | < 70 |
| Cash Balance | sarah | $200K | Weekly | >= $200K | < $200K |
| Support Tickets Closed | daniel | 50 | Weekly | >= 50 | < 50 |
```

## Vision Format

**Location:** `data/vision.md`

The V/TO (Vision/Traction Organizer) is a pure markdown document — no YAML frontmatter. It contains 8 sections covering the full EOS strategic framework.

### Structure

```markdown
# Vision/Traction Organizer

## [Company Name]

*Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD*

## Core Values
[3-7 guiding principles]

## Core Focus
[Purpose + Niche]

## 10-Year Target
[One big goal]

## Marketing Strategy
[Target Market, 3 Uniques, Proven Process, Guarantee]

## 3-Year Picture
[Revenue, profit, headcount, what it looks like]

## 1-Year Plan
[Revenue goal, profit goal, measurables, goals]

## Quarterly Rocks
[Reference to data/rocks/ — managed by ceos-rocks]

## Issues List
[Reference to data/issues/ — managed by ceos-ids]
```

The Quarterly Rocks and Issues List sections are pointers to other data directories — they're managed by `ceos-rocks` and `ceos-ids` respectively, not edited directly in the V/TO.

---

## Accountability Chart Format

**Location:** `data/accountability.md`

Pure markdown document — no YAML frontmatter. Describes the company's organizational structure using EOS's "right person, right seat" framework.

### Structure

```markdown
# Accountability Chart

## [Company Name]

## [Function Name]
**Seat:** [Role title]
**Person:** [Name]

### Roles
- [Key responsibility]
- [Key responsibility]
```

### Key Conventions

- **Rocks** are organized by quarter: `data/rocks/YYYY-QN/`
- **Issues** are organized by state: `data/issues/open/` and `data/issues/solved/`
- **Scorecard weeks** use ISO week numbering: `data/scorecard/weeks/YYYY-WNN.md`
- **L10 meetings** use date: `data/meetings/l10/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Vision and Accountability** are single files at the `data/` root

## Parsing

To parse a CEOS data file in any language:

1. Read the file as text
2. Split on the first two `---` lines to extract YAML frontmatter
3. Parse the YAML block into a key-value structure
4. The remaining text is markdown — parse as needed

Most languages have YAML and markdown parsers available. The format is intentionally simple enough that a regex-based parser works for basic use cases.

## Versioning

The data format follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as part of the CEOS project:

- **Breaking changes** (renaming fields, changing status values, removing fields) require a major version bump and an RFC-style discussion
- **Non-breaking additions** (new optional fields) are minor version changes
- **Documentation and clarifications** are patch version changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the process around data format changes.
