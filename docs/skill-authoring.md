# Skill Authoring Guide

How to write a new CEOS skill or improve an existing one. This guide is for both EOS practitioners and developers.

## When to Write a New Skill

Before creating a new skill, ask these questions:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Is this a core EOS tool not yet covered? | New skill | Check existing skills |
| Does it extend an existing skill's workflow? | Add a mode to the existing skill | New skill may be warranted |
| Is it EOS-specific? | Belongs in CEOS | Consider a general-purpose skill instead |
| Do multiple teams need this? | Good candidate | Maybe keep it as a custom skill in your fork |

The current 17 skills cover the full EOS toolkit — from core tools like V/TO and Rocks to advanced workflows like L10 meetings, Annual Planning, and Organizational Checkups.

## Skill File Structure

Every CEOS skill lives in `skills/ceos-NAME/SKILL.md`. The file follows a unified 8-section structure defined in the [Skill Structure Contract](skill-structure.md).

### The 8 Sections

Every CEOS skill follows the same 8-section structure, in this order:

#### 1. YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: ceos-example
description: Use when [trigger condition — when should Claude invoke this skill]
file-access: [data/example/, templates/example.md]
tools-used: [Read, Write, Glob]
---
```

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Matches the directory name (`ceos-vto`, `ceos-rocks`, etc.) |
| `description` | Yes | Starts with "Use when" — trigger phrase, not workflow summary |
| `file-access` | Recommended | Directories and files the skill reads or writes |
| `tools-used` | Recommended | Claude Code tools the skill relies on (`Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash`) |

**Important:** The `description` should say **when** to use the skill, not **what** it does. Claude uses the description to decide whether to invoke the skill, so it needs to match user intent.

| Good Description | Bad Description |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Use when setting, tracking, or scoring quarterly Rocks" | "Manages quarterly Rocks with three modes" |
| "Use when running or reviewing a Level 10 weekly meeting" | "Facilitates L10 meetings with 7 sections" |

The `file-access` and `tools-used` fields are a declaration of intent that makes code review faster. Reviewers compare what the manifest says against what the skill body actually does.

#### 2. `# skill-name` Heading

A top-level heading matching the `name` field, followed by a one-paragraph description of the skill's purpose.

```markdown
# ceos-rocks

Manage quarterly Rocks — the 3-7 most important priorities each person
commits to achieving in a 90-day period.
```

This paragraph helps Claude understand the skill's scope when deciding whether to invoke it.

#### 3. When to Use

A bullet list of trigger phrases — things a user might say that should activate this skill.

```markdown
## When to Use

- "Set rocks for this quarter" or "let's plan our quarterly priorities"
- "Rock status" or "how are our rocks tracking?"
- "Score rocks" or "end of quarter review"
```

Include both formal EOS terminology ("IDS this") and natural language ("we have a problem"). Teams vary in how much EOS jargon they use.

#### 4. Context

Tell Claude what it needs to know before executing the skill.

**Repo detection** (required in every CEOS skill):

```markdown
### Finding the CEOS Repository

Search upward from the current directory for the `.ceos` marker file.
This file marks the root of the CEOS repository.

If `.ceos` is not found, stop and tell the user:
"Not in a CEOS repository. Clone your CEOS repo and run setup.sh first."
```

**Key files table** — list every file/directory the skill reads or writes:

```markdown
### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/rocks/QUARTER/` | Rock files for each quarter |
| `templates/rock.md` | Template for new Rock files |
```

**Data format details** — document any YAML frontmatter fields, status enums, or naming conventions the skill needs to understand.

#### 5. Process

Step-by-step instructions for Claude to follow. This is the core of the skill.

**Use modes** when a skill handles multiple workflows. Each mode has its own step sequence:

```markdown
## Process

### Mode: Setting Rocks
[Steps for creating new Rocks]

### Mode: Tracking Rocks
[Steps for weekly status updates]

### Mode: Scoring Rocks
[Steps for end-of-quarter review]
```

**Be specific.** Claude follows these instructions literally. Include:
- What to read and display
- What questions to ask the user
- How to validate input
- What to write and where
- Example output formats

#### 6. Output Format

Describe what the skill's output should look like for each mode.

```markdown
## Output Format

**Setting:** Show each Rock file before writing. End with a summary table.
**Tracking:** Status table with milestone progress.
**Scoring:** Quarter scorecard with completion rate.
```

#### 7. Guardrails

Constraints that prevent the skill from doing the wrong thing. These are the most important part of a well-designed skill.

```markdown
## Guardrails

- **Always show diff before writing.** Never modify a file without approval.
- **One owner per Rock.** Suggest splitting if user tries to share.
- **3-7 per person.** Warn if outside this range.
```

Every skill MUST include these two universal guardrails:

- **Auto-invoke guardrail**: Don't auto-invoke other skills. When results suggest using another skill (e.g., quarterly conversation reveals People Analyzer needs updating), mention the option but let the user decide. Say "Would you like to update X?" rather than doing it automatically.
- **Sensitive data warning**: On first use in a session, remind the user that CEOS data contains sensitive information (performance evaluations, strategic decisions, financial targets, personnel matters). The repo should be private.

Good guardrails prevent:
- Data loss (always show before writing)
- EOS anti-patterns (shared ownership, too many Rocks)
- Scope creep (don't modify files that belong to other skills)
- Silent failures (validate inputs, check for missing files)

#### 8. Integration Notes

Documents how this skill relates to other CEOS skills. Each integration entry specifies:

- **Direction**: Read, Write, or Related
- **What data**: Which files/directories are accessed
- **Purpose**: Why the cross-skill access exists

End with a **Write Principle** or **Orchestration Principle** statement declaring data ownership:

```markdown
## Integration Notes

- **Reads** `data/vision.md` (ceos-vto) — aligns Rocks to V/TO goals
- **Related** `data/scorecard/` (ceos-scorecard) — Rock completion feeds metrics

**Write Principle:** Only `ceos-rocks` writes to `data/rocks/`.
Other skills read Rock data for reference.
```

**Write Principle** (most skills): Declares which data directory this skill exclusively owns.

**Orchestration Principle** (for L10, Annual Planning, Quarterly Planning, Kickoff): These skills read data from multiple skills during sessions but defer to each skill for formal create/update operations.

## Data Integration Patterns

### Reading Data

Skills read from the `data/` directory tree. Always check if files exist before trying to read them, and tell the user to run `setup.sh init` if key files are missing.

```markdown
Read all files in `data/rocks/[current-quarter]/`.
If the directory doesn't exist, create it.
If no Rock files exist: "No Rocks set for this quarter yet."
```

### Using Templates

New data files should be based on templates in `templates/`. This ensures consistent structure across companies.

```markdown
Use `templates/rock.md` as the template. Fill in:
- Frontmatter: id, title, owner, quarter, status=on_track, created=today
- Body: measurable outcome and milestones from the user
```

### Writing Data

**Always show a diff or preview before writing.** This is the single most important guardrail. CEOS data is business-critical — a corrupted V/TO or lost Issue could affect real business decisions.

```markdown
Show the file before writing. Ask: "Create this Rock?"
```

### ID Generation

Skills that create numbered files (Rocks, Issues) must generate unique IDs:

```markdown
Read existing files in the directory.
Find the highest existing ID number.
Increment by 1 for the new file.
Check BOTH open/ and solved/ directories (for Issues).
```

## Cross-Skill Coordination

CEOS skills are **loosely coupled**. A skill can mention another skill but should never auto-invoke it.

| Do This | Don't Do This |
|---------|---------------|
| "Consider creating an Issue with `ceos-ids`" | Automatically calling ceos-ids |
| "Check Rock alignment with `ceos-vto`" | Reading and modifying the V/TO directly |
| "This off-track metric should go to the Issues list" | Creating an Issue file without the user's say-so |

Why? The user controls the workflow. During an L10 meeting, the facilitator decides when to switch from Scorecard Review to IDS. Skills should suggest, not command.

## Security & Scope Boundaries

CEOS skills run inside Claude Code with the user's full permissions. A skill can read files, write files, and execute commands. This power requires discipline — skills should do the minimum necessary and stay within well-defined boundaries.

### Scope Rules

Every CEOS skill should follow these scope rules:

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Only access `data/` and `templates/`** | Company EOS data lives here — nothing else should be touched |
| **Never reference external URLs or APIs** | Skills should work offline; external calls could exfiltrate data |
| **Never handle credentials** | No asking for API keys, passwords, or tokens |
| **Never instruct shell commands** | File operations go through Claude's built-in tools, not `bash` |
| **Always show before writing** | The user must approve every file change (the "diff before write" rule) |
| **Stay in the CEOS repo** | The `.ceos` marker detection ensures skills don't operate outside the repo |

### Security Manifest (Frontmatter Fields)

The `file-access` and `tools-used` frontmatter fields (see [Section 1: YAML Frontmatter](#1-yaml-frontmatter) above) double as a security manifest. Reviewers compare what these fields declare against what the skill body actually does.

These fields are **not enforced at runtime** — they're a declaration of intent that makes code review faster.

### What NOT to Put in a Skill

| Don't Do This | Why | What to Do Instead |
|---------------|-----|-------------------|
| `Read ~/.ssh/id_rsa` | Accesses files outside CEOS repo | Only read from `data/` and `templates/` |
| `Run curl https://api.example.com/...` | External network call | Skills should work offline |
| `Ask the user for their API key` | Credential harvesting risk | Skills don't need external service credentials |
| `Write to /tmp/export.csv` | Writes outside CEOS repo | Write to `data/` directory |
| `Delete all files in data/rocks/` | Destructive bulk operation | Modify individual files with user confirmation |
| `Automatically invoke ceos-ids` | Breaks user control principle | Suggest the skill; let user invoke it |

### Well-Scoped vs Suspicious: Examples

**Well-scoped skill manifest:**

```yaml
---
name: ceos-rocks
description: Use when setting, tracking, or scoring quarterly Rocks
file-access: [data/rocks/, templates/rock.md]
tools-used: [Read, Write, Glob]
---
```

This skill reads Rock files, creates new ones from a template, and lists directory contents. All within `data/` and `templates/`. Straightforward to review.

**Suspicious skill manifest:**

```yaml
---
name: ceos-export
description: Use when exporting EOS data
file-access: [data/, ~/.config/export/]
tools-used: [Read, Write, Bash, WebFetch]
---
```

Red flags: accesses files outside the repo (`~/.config/`), uses `Bash` (shell commands), and uses `WebFetch` (external network access). A reviewer should ask: why does an export skill need network access and shell commands?

## Testing Your Skill

CEOS skills are tested manually with Claude Code:

1. **Install the skill**: Run `./setup.sh` to symlink your skill into `~/.claude/skills/`
2. **Start Claude Code**: `claude` in your CEOS repo directory
3. **Try each trigger phrase**: Does Claude recognize the skill?
4. **Test each mode**: Walk through every workflow path
5. **Test edge cases**:
   - What happens with no data files? (first-time setup)
   - What happens with malformed frontmatter?
   - What happens if the user gives unexpected input?
   - What if required files are missing?

## Submitting Your Skill

1. **Open an Issue first** — describe the EOS process your skill implements
2. **Fork the repo** and create your skill in `skills/ceos-NAME/SKILL.md`
3. **Follow the naming convention**: `ceos-` prefix, lowercase, hyphen-separated
4. **Update docs** — add your skill to [skill-reference.md](skill-reference.md)
5. **Submit a PR** with:
   - The SKILL.md file
   - Before/after examples showing the skill in action
   - Which EOS tool or process it implements
