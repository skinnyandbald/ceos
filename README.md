# CEOS

**Run EOS with AI.** CEOS brings the [Entrepreneurial Operating System](https://www.eosworldwide.com/) to [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), giving your leadership team 16 AI-powered skills for Vision, Accountability Chart, Rocks, Scorecard, L10 Meetings, IDS, To-Dos, Process, People Analyzer, Quarterly Conversations, Annual Planning, Quarterly Planning, Organizational Checkup, Delegate and Elevate, Clarity Break, and EOS Kickoff.

Clone. Setup. Run your business.

## What is CEOS?

CEOS (Claude + EOS) is a Claude Code skills package that implements the core EOS tools as AI-assisted workflows. Your EOS data lives as markdown files in your repo — human-readable, GitHub-renderable, and git-diffable. No database, no SaaS subscription, no vendor lock-in.

**Designed for CEOs and leadership teams**, not developers. If you can run `git clone` and `./setup.sh`, you're ready. Start with Focus Day, build your V/TO in Vision Building Days, then run EOS with the full skill set.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone (or fork for your company)
git clone https://github.com/bradfeld/ceos.git
cd ceos

# 2. Install skills + initialize your company data
./setup.sh init

# 3. Start using EOS in any Claude Code session

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  skills/ceos-*/SKILL.md         │  ← Claude Code skills (16 EOS tools)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  data/ + templates/             │  ← Your EOS data (markdown files)
│  (markdown + YAML frontmatter)  │     Human-readable, git-tracked

```

**Three layers:**

- **Upstream** (`bradfeld/ceos`) — Skills, templates, docs. No company data.
- **Your fork** (`your-company/ceos`) — Your team's EOS data in `data/`.
- **Personal config** (`.ceos-user.yaml`, gitignored) — Per-person preferences.

## Data Format

All EOS data is stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter. Example Rock:

```markdown
---
id: rock-001
title: Launch Beta Program
owner: brad
quarter: 2026-Q1
status: on_track
created: 2026-01-02
due: 2026-03-31
---

## Measurable Outcome

Beta program launched with 10+ users actively providing feedback.

## Milestones

- [ ] Beta invitation system built
- [ ] First 10 users onboarded
- [ ] Feedback collection process established
```

Everything is a file. Git history is your audit trail.

## For Teams

CEOS is built for multi-person leadership teams:

1. **Fork** this repo to your company's GitHub
2. Run `./setup.sh init` — each team member does this once
3. **Commit data** to your fork — git is the collaboration layer
4. **Pull upstream** for skill updates — your data stays untouched

## Security

CEOS skills are **instructions that Claude Code follows with your permissions** — including reading files, writing files, and running commands. This is powerful, but it means you should treat skill files like code: review before you run.

### If you fork or clone from upstream (`bradfeld/ceos`)

The official skills are maintained and reviewed by the project maintainers. Pulling upstream updates is safe as long as you verify the remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin   # Should point to bradfeld/ceos or your company's fork
```

### If you install skills from other sources

Before running `./setup.sh` on a repo you didn't write:

1. **Read every `SKILL.md` file.** They're plain markdown — you can understand what they do.
2. **Watch for red flags:** instructions that access files outside `data/` or `templates/`, references to external URLs or APIs, requests for credentials or API keys, or shell commands beyond basic git operations.
3. **Check the git history.** `git log --oneline skills/` shows what changed and when.

### For contributors
